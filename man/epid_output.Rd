\value{
A list containing, for each required type of output, a matrix summarising the output for each year and cultivar

Each matrix can be written in a txt file (if writeTXT=TRUE), and illustrated in a graphic (if graphic=TRUE).
}
\description{
Generates epidemiological and economic outputs from model simulations.
}
\details{
Outputs are computed every year for every cultivar as well as for the whole landscape. \describe{
\item{\strong{Epidemiological outputs.}}{
The epidemiological impact of pathogen spread can be evaluated by different measures: \enumerate{
\item Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC): average number of diseased host individuals (status I + R)
per time step and square meter.
\item Relative Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPCr): average proportion of diseased host individuals
(status I + R) relative to the total number of existing hosts (H+L+I+R).
\item Green Leaf Area (GLA): average number of healthy host individuals (status H) per time step and per square meter.
\item Relative Green Leaf Area (GLAr): average proportion of healthy host individuals (status H) relative to the total number
of existing hosts (H+L+I+R).
\item Contribution of pathogen genotypes: for every year and every host (as well as for the whole landscape and the whole
simulation duration), fraction of cumulative LIR infections attributed to each pathogen genotype.
}
}
\item{\strong{Economic outputs.}}{
The economic outcome of a simulation can be evaluated using: \enumerate{
\item Crop yield: yearly crop yield (e.g. grains, fruits, wine) in weight (or volume) units
per hectare (depends on the number of productive hosts and associated theoretical yield).
\item Crop products: yearly product generated from sales, in monetary units per hectare
(depends on crop yield and market value). Note that when disease = "mildew" a price reduction
between 0\% and 5\% is applied to the market value depending on disease severity.
\item Operational crop costs: yearly costs associated with crop planting (depends on initial
host density and planting cost) and pesticide treatments (depends on the number of applications and
the cost of a single application) in monetary units per hectare.
\item Crop margin, i.e. products - operational costs, in monetary units per hectare.
