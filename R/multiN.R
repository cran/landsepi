#' @title Allocation of cultivars
#' @name multiN
#' @description Algorithm based on latent Gaussian fields to allocate two different crop cultivars across the simulated landscapes. 
#' @param d a matrix of the pairwise distances between the centroids of the fields of the landscape.
#' @param area vector containing the areas of the fields.
#' @param aggreg level of spatial aggregation (<0 for fragmented landscapes, >0 for aggregated landscapes, =0 for random allocation of cultivars).
#' @param prop relative proportion of the second crop. 
#' @details This algorithm allows the control of the proportions of each cultivar in terms of surface coverage, and their level of spatial aggregation. 
#' A random vector of values is drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with expectation 0 and a variance-covariance matrix 
#' which depends on the pairwise distances between the centroids of the fields. The variance-covariance matrix is computed from a periodic function for highly 
#' fragmented or highly aggregated landscapes, an exponential function for moderately aggregated landscapes, and from a normal distribution for a random allocation of 
#' cultivars. Next, the crop cultivars are allocated to different fields depending on whether the each value drawn from the multivariate normal distribution 
#' is above or below a threshold. The proportion of each cultivar in the landscape is controlled by the value of this threshold (parameter prop). 
#' @return A dataframe containing the index of each field (column 1) and the index (0 or 1) of the cultivar grown on these fields (column 2).
