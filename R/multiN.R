#' @title Allocation of cultivars
#' @name multiN
#' @description Algorithm based on latent Gaussian fields to allocate two different types of crops across the simulated landscapes. 
#' @param d a matrix of the pairwise distances between the centroids of the fields of the landscape.
#' @param area vector containing the areas of the fields.
#' @param range range of spatial autocorrelation between fields (<0 for fragmented landscapes, >0 for aggregated landscapes, =0 for random allocation).
#' @param prop relative proportion of the second type of crop. 
#' @details This algorithm allows the control of the proportions of each type of crop in terms of surface coverage, and their level of spatial aggregation. 
#' A random vector of values is drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with expectation 0 and a variance-covariance matrix 
#' which depends on the pairwise distances between the centroids of the fields. The variance-covariance matrix is computed from a periodic function for highly 
#' fragmented or highly aggregated types of crops, an exponential function for moderately aggregated types of crops, and from a normal distribution for a random allocation of 
#' the types of crops. Next, the two types of crops are allocated to different fields depending on whether the each value drawn from the multivariate normal distribution 
#' is above or below a threshold. The proportion of each type of crop in the landscape is controlled by the value of this threshold (parameter prop). 
#' @return A dataframe containing the index of each field (column 1) and the index (0 or 1) of the type of crop grown on these fields (column 2).
