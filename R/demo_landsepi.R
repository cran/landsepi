#' Run demo landsepi
#' @title Package demonstration
#' @name demo_landsepi
#' @description Run a demonstration of the package.
#' @param seed an integer used as seed value (for random number generator)
#' @details Run a 30-year simulated example of mosaic deployment strategy of two resistant cultivars in balanced proportions and 
#' high level of spatial aggregation. The generated model outputs are text files, graphics and a video.
