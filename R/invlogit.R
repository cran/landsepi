#' @title Inverse logit function
#' @name invlogit
#' @description Given a numeric object return the invlogit of the values. Missing values (NAs) are allowed. 
#' @param x a numeric object
#' @details The invlogit is defined by exp(x) / (1+exp(x)). Values in x of -Inf or Inf return invlogits of 0 or 1 respectively. Any NAs in the input will also be NAs in the output. 
#' @return An object of the same type as x containing the invlogits of the input values.
#' @examples
#' invlogit(10)
#' @export
invlogit <- function(x) exp(x) / (1+exp(x))
