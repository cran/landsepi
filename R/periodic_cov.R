#' @title Periodic covariance function
#' @name periodic_cov
#' @description Periodic function used to compute the variance-covariance matrix of the fields of the landscape. 
#' @param d a numeric object containing pairwise distances between the centroids of the fields
#' @param range range (half-period of oscillations)
#' @param phi amplitude of the oscillations
#' @details The periodic covariance is defined by exp(-2 * sin(d*pi/(2*range))^2 / phi^2). It is used to generate highly fragmented or highly aggregated landscapes.
#' @return An object of the same type as d. 
#' @examples
#' periodic_cov(10, range=5)
#' @export
periodic_cov <- function(d,range,phi=1) {  return( exp(-2 * sin(d*pi/(2*range))^2 / phi^2) ) }
