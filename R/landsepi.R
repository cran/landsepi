#'
#' The landsepi package implements a spatially explicit stochastic model able to assess the epidemiological,
#' evolutionary and economic outcomes of strategies to deploy plant resistance to pathogens. 
#' It also helps investigate the effect of landscape organisation, the considered pathosystem and
#' the epidemio-evolutionary context on the performance of a given strategy.
#' 
#' It is based on a spatial geometry for describing the landscape and allocation of different cultivars,
#' a dispersal kernel for the dissemination of the pathogen,
#' and a SEIR (‘susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed’, renamed HLIR for 'healthy-latent-infectious-removed'
#' to avoid confusions with 'susceptible host') structure with a discrete time step. It simulates the spread and
#' evolution (via mutation, recombination through sexual reproduction, selection and drift) 
#' of a pathogen in a heterogeneous cropping landscape, across cropping seasons split by host harvests which impose
#' potential bottlenecks to the pathogen.
#'
#' The lansdcape is represented by a set of polygons where the pathogen can disperse
#' (the basic spatial unit is an individual polygon; an agricultural field may be composed of a single 
#' or several polygons). *landsepi* includes built-in simulated landscapes 
#' (and associated dispersal matrices for rust pathogens, see below), but is it possible 
#' to use your own landscape (in shapefile format) and dispersal matrix.  
#' 
#' A wide array of resistance deployment strategies can be simulated in landsepi: fields of the 
#' landscape are cultivated with different croptypes that can rotate through time; each croptype is
#' composed of either a pure cultivar or a mixture; and each cultivar may carry one or several resistance 
#' genes. Thus, all combinations of rotations, mosaics, mixtures and pyramiding strategies are 
#' possible. Resistance genes affect several possible pathogen aggressiveness components: 
#' infection rate, durations of the latent period and the infectious period, and propagule
#' production rate. Resistance may be complete (i.e. complete inhibition of the targeted aggressiveness component) or partial
#' (i.e. the targeted aggressiveness component is only softened), and expressed from the beginning of the season, or later
#' (to simulate Adult Plant Resistance (APR), also called Mature Plant Resistance). 
#' Cultivar allocation can be realised via an algorithm (\code{allocateCroptypeCultivars()}) 
#' but it is possible to use your own cultivar allocation if it is included in the shapefile 
#' containing the landsape. 
#' Additionally, any cultivar may be treated with contact pesticides, which reduce the pathogen infection rate 
#' with an efficiency gradually decreasing with time and host growth.
#'
#' To each resistance gene in the host (whether it may be a major gene or a QTL for quantitative resistance) 
#' is associated a pathogenicity gene in the pathogen.
#' Through mutation of pathogenicity genes, the pathogen can restore its aggressiveness on resistance hosts and thus
#' adapt to resistance (leading to sudden breakdown or gradual erosion of resistance genes).
#' Pathogenicity genes may also be reassorted via sexual reproduction or gene recombination.
#' Increased aggressiveness on a resistant host (i.e. adaptation to the corresponding resistance genes)
#' can be penalised by a fitness cost, either on all hosts, or only on susceptible hosts (in the latter case, 
#' pathogen genotypes adapted to a resistance gene have a reduced aggressiveness on hosts that do not carry this gene, 
#' and a 'relative advantage' on host that do carry such gene). 
#' The relation between pathogen aggressiveness on susceptible and resistant hosts
#' is defined by a trade-off relationship whose shape depends on the strength of the trade-off. 
#' Strong trade-off means that the gain in fitness on resistant hosts is smaller than the cost on susceptible hosts.
#' 
#' The package includes five examples of landscape structures and a default parameterisation to represent
#' plant pathogens as typified by rusts of cereal crops (genus \emph{Puccinia},
#' e.g. stripe rust, stem rust and leaf rust of wheat and barley). A parameterisation to
#' downy mildew of grapevine (\emph{Plasmopara viticola}) and black sigatoka of banana 
#' (\emph{Pseudocercospora fijiensis}) are also available.
#' The main function of the package is \code{runSimul()}.
#' It can be parameterised to simulate various resistance deployment strategies using either the provided 
#' landscapes and parameters for cereal rusts, or landscapes and parameters set by the user. 
#' See \code{demo_landsepi()} for a demonstration, and our tutorials (\code{browseVignettes("landsepi")}) 
#' for details on how to use landsepi.
#'
#' \describe{
#' \item{\strong{Assumptions} (in bold those that can be relaxed with appropriate parameterization): }{
#' \enumerate{
#' 
#' 
#'  \item The spatial unit is a polygon, i.e. a piece of land delimited by boundaries and possibly 
#'  cultivated with a crop. Such crop may be host or non-host, and the polygon is considered a homogeneous 
#'  mixture of host individuals (i.e. there is no intra-polygon structuration). 
#'  A field may be composed of a single or several polygons.
#'  \item Host individuals are in one of these four categories: H (healthy), E (exposed and latent, 
#'  i.e. infected but not infectious nor symptomatic), I (infectious and symptomatic), or R 
#'  (removed, i.e. epidemiologically inactive).
#'  \item **A host ‘individual’ is an infection unit and may correspond to a given amount of plant tissue 
#'  (where a local infection may develop, e.g. fungal lesion) or a whole plant (e.g. systemic viral infection). 
#'  In the first case, plant growth increases the amount of available plant tissue 
#'  (hence the number of individuals) during the cropping season.** Plant growth is deterministic (logistic growth) 
#'  and **only healthy individuals (state H) contribute to plant growth (castrating pathogen)**.
#'  \item **The decreasing availability of healthy host tissues (as epidemics spread) makes pathogen 
#'  infection less likely (i.e. density-dependence due to plant architecture).**
#'  \item **Host are cultivated (i.e. sown/planted and harvested), thus there is no host reproduction, 
#'  dispersal and natural death.**
#'  \item Environmental and climate conditions are constant, and host individuals of a given genotype 
#'  are equally susceptible to disease from the first to the last day of every cropping season.
#'  \item Crop yield depends on the average amount of producing host individuals during the cropping 
#'  season and does not depend on the time of epidemic peak. **Only healthy individuals (state H) 
#'  contribute to crop yield.**
#'  \item Cultivars may be treated with chemicals which reduce the pathogen infection rate (contact treatment). 
#'  Treatment efficiency decreases with host growth (i.e. new biomass is not protected by treatments) 
#'  **and time (i.e. pesticide degradation)**. Cultivars to be treated and dates of chemical applications 
#'  are fixed prior to simulations but only polygons where disease severity exceeds a given threshold (possibly 0) are treated. 
#'  \item Components of a mixture are independent each other (i.e. there is neither plant-plant 
#'  interaction nor competition for space, and harvests are segregated). If one component is treated 
#'  with a chemical, it does not affect other components. 
#'  \item The pathogen is haploid.
#'  \item **Initially, the pathogen is not adapted to any source of resistance, and is only present on 
#'  susceptible hosts (at state I).**
#'  \item **Pathogen dispersal is isotropic (i.e. equally probable in every direction).**
#'  \item **Boundaries of the landscape are reflective: propagules stay in the system as if it was closed.** 
#'  \item Pathogen reproduction can be purely clonal, purely sexual, or mixed (alternation of clonal 
#'  and sexual reproduction).
#'  \item If there is sexual reproduction (or gene recombination), it occurs only between parental 
#'  infections located in the same polygon and the same host genotype. At that scale, the pathogen 
#'  population is panmictic (i.e. all pairs of parents have the same probability to occur). 
#'  The propagule production rate of a parental pair is the sum of the propagule production rates of 
#'  the parents. For a given parental pair, the genotype of each propagule is issued from random loci 
#'  segregation of parental qualitative resistance genes. For each quantitative resistance gene, the 
#'  value of each propagule trait is issued from a normal distribution around the average of the 
#'  parental traits, following the infinitesimal model (Fisher 1919).
#'  \item All types of propagules (i.e. clonal and sexual) share the same pathogenicity parameters 
#'  (e.g. infection rate, latent period duration, etc.) but each of them has their own dispersal and survival 
#'  abilities (see after). 
#'  \item At the end of each cropping season, pathogens experience a bottleneck representing the 
#'  off-season and then propagules are produced (either via clonal or sexual reproduction). 
#'  **The probability of survival is the same every year and in every polygon.** 
#'  Clonal propagules are released during the following season only, either altogether at the first day of 
#'  the season, or progressively (in that case the day of release of each propagule is sampled from 
#'  a uniform distribution). Sexual propagules are gradually released during several of the following 
#'  seasons (between-season release). The season of release of each propagule is sampled from an 
#'  exponential distribution, truncated by a maximum viability limit. Then, the day of release in a 
#'  given season is sampled from a uniform distribution (within-season release).
#'  \item Pathogenicity genes mutate independently from each other.
#'  \item **Pathogen adaptation to a given resistance gene consists in restoring the same aggressiveness 
#'  component as the one targeted by the resistance gene.**
#'  \item If a fitness cost penalises pathogen adaptation to a given resistance gene, this cost is paid 
#'  **on hosts that do not carry this gene, or, alternatively, on all hosts with possibly a relative 
#'  advantage on hosts carrying the resistance gene**. It consists in a reduction in the same aggressiveness 
#'  component as the one targeted by the resistance gene.
#'  \item When there is a delay for activation of a given resistance gene (APR), the age of activation 
#'  is the same for all hosts carrying this gene and located in the same polygon.
#'  \item Variances of the durations of the latent and the infectious periods of the pathogen are 
#'  not affected by plant resistance.

#'  }

#' \item{\strong{Epidemiological outputs}}{
#' The epidemiological outcome of a deployment strategy is evaluated using: \enumerate{
#' \item the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) to measure disease severity
#' (i.e. the average number of diseased plant tissue -status I and R- per time step and square meter),
#' \item the relative area under the disease progress curve (AUDPCr) to measure the average proportion 
#' of diseased tissue (status I and R) relative to the total number of existing host individuals (H+L+I+R).
#' \item the Green Leaf Area (GLA) to measure the average amount of healthy plant tissue (status H) per time step and square meter,
#' \item the relative Green Leaf Area (GLAr) to measure the average proportion of healthy tissue (status H)
#' relative to the total number of existing host individuals (H+L+I+R).
#' \item the yearly contribution of pathogen genotypes to LIR dynamics on every host as well as the whole landscape.
#'   }
#' A set of graphics and a video showing epidemic dynamics can also be generated.
#'  }

#' \item{\strong{Evolutionary outputs}}{
#' The evolutionary outcome is assessed by measuring: \enumerate{
#' \item the dynamics of pathogen genotype frequencies,
#' \item the evolution of pathogen aggressiveness,
#' \item the durability of resistance genes. Durability can be estimated using the time until the pathogen reaches the three
#' steps to adapt to plant resistance: (1) first appearance of adapted mutants,
#' (2) initial migration to resistant hosts and infection, and
#' (3) broader establishment in the resistant host population (i.e. the point at which extinction becomes unlikely).
#'   }
#'  }

#' \item{\strong{Economic outputs}}{
#' The economic outcome of a simulation can be evaluated using: \enumerate{
#' \item the crop yield: yearly crop production (e.g. grains, fruits, wine) in weight (or volume) units
#' per hectare (depends on the number of productive hosts and associated theoretical yield),
#' \item the crop products: yearly products generated from sales, in monetary units per hectare
#' (depends on crop yield and market value),
#' \item the crop operational costs: yearly costs associated with crop planting (depends on initial 
#' host density and planting cost) and pesticide treatments (depends on the number of applications and 
#' the cost of a single application) in monetary units per hectare.
#' \item the margin, i.e. products - operational costs, in monetary units per hectare.
